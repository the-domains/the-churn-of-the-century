"><p>The second, increasingly, is the satisfaction that comes from knowing you did something well. I still have a long way to go to understand the ins and outs of ice cream making. I know I’ve only scratched the surface, but it gives me hope that even the
    professional ice cream chefs I’ve had the opportunity to meet are still learning.</p><p>I started making ice cream in October 2009, after returning to college having spent the summer in Portland working at my aunt and uncle’s restaurant, Gino’s. I can actually pinpoint the moment I realized that making ice cream at home was even possible.</p><p>I was bussing tables one night that summer and happened to be serving my great aunt and uncle on their anniversary. Their daughters (my cousins) had gotten them an ice cream machine to celebrate the occasion. What better way to celebrate… anything?</p><picture>

</picture><p>It was a big moment. Like pizza and Chinese food, for most Americans ice cream is something that you go out for. You don’t just decide to make ice cream on a Tuesday night after work, like you might decide to open up a box of Annie’s macaroni and cheese.</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be that way, and once the seed had been planted it was only a matter of time. My college roommate and I were moving back into a shared room that fall, and I floated the idea of buying a shared ice cream maker to him. Benjamin was
    on board. I must have made somewhere in the ballpark of 100 batches since then.</p><p>A freshly spun batch of ice cream is a frozen container of joy. That it never feels like anything less is the reason that this hobby has persisted after so many others have faded.</p><p>At this stage of my ice cream making career (career?) I have learned a lot that would be hard for others to discover independently. Hopefully the pace of that learning continues to accelerate, and if I keep churning then it’s safe to say it will. This
    blog’s purpose will be to chronicle and reflect on that learning, as well as to give it some structure—both for my own benefit, and perhaps for a small handful of other ice cream nerds.</p><p>Here’s to the next seven years of freaking out—some of which will hopefully be amplified by writing about it.</p><picture>
